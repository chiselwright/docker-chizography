    <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span> About Chisel</h3>

    <div class="well">
        <p>Before you ask: <i>Yes</i>, Chisel is my real name. <i>No</i>, Chisel is not
        my birth name.</p>

        <p>I was born in 1974, and soon christened something that definitely wasn't
        Chisel.  I grew up, finished school, finished my A-levels and went to
        university. Being such a kind soul I joined <i>Rag</i>. This was (and probably
        still is) a group of people who went out with collecting tins to collect money
        for various charities. One of the informal rules was that the members of Rag
        had to have a nickname. After one collection in Sheffield, the group was
        counting up the money collected for the day, someone looked at me and realised
        that I didn't have a nickname yet. I was standing there with a collecting-tin
        in one hand, and a chisel in the other.  [one effective method for opening the
        collecting-tins]. So I became Chisel. In many ways this was quite lucky; I
        could have been called Collecting-Tin.  I got off better than other group
        members. Ask Shaggy and Dribble if you don't believe me.</p>

        <p>For some reason, my flatmates found out about the nickname, and started
        using it.  The nickname just spread, like some social variant of <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Red_(computer_worm)">Code Red</a>. Soon
        everyone was calling me Chisel. Soon after I was introducing myself as Chisel.
        After a few years of this, I got fed-up with bills and statements arriving
        addressed to someone I no longer associated myself with. So I found a suitable
        website, and changed my name by deed poll.</p>

        <p>And thus, Chisel was official.</p>

        <h3>More about Chisel</h3>

        <p>Drifting through life I realised that I had an interest in computers.  I'd
        always found them interesting as a hobby, and at university I took the leap,
        and did a joint honours degree, half of which was Computer Science. This woke
        my thirst for all things computer related. I left university determined to
        become a programmer (or Software Engineer, or whatever the current in-phrase is
        for what I do). I spent my first year working at Mastercare on PC hardware and
        software support. After a year I moved from Nottingham to Sussex to pursue my
        programming dream.</p>

        <p>I weedled my way into a job (C programmer), and have since moved from
        job-to-job.  As time went on my interests changed, and these days I'm deeply
        addicted to programming in Perl. This doesn't mean I can't use any other
        languages - it just means I'll either be a little rusty, or will have to learn
        it all from scratch. [hey, I did teach myself Perl, and now people are paying
        me for it!].</p>

        <h3>Things I've done</h3>

        <p>During my technical years I've used a number of skills. Some I've not used
        for some time, others I use a great deal. If you want you know more, either
        guess based on my passion for Linux and open source, or drop me a line.  The
        list goes something like this: building and maintaining PCs; Windows 95;
        Windows 98; Access 97 (including VBA); installing and maintaining linux
        machines; C; lex; yacc; Perl; postgres; mysql; HTML; XML; home networking;
